Dive Into Bitcoin
=================

If you've heard of bitcoin, and you're curious about it, but you don't know where to begin with it, this guide is for you!

Introduction
------------

Bitcoin is a protocol for storing and transmitting value that is both independent of location and doesn't depend on a trusted central authority.
Let's go through these terms one-by-one and make sense of them.

First, bitcoin is a *protocol*, which means it is a way of going about doing something.
Another example of a protocol is driving on the right side of the road.
This is a way of going about doing something (driving on the street) that, so long as other people do things this way (such as driving on the right side rather than the left side), it all works out.
Other important examples of protocols are: the internet, email, the web, using gold as money, and using dollars as money.

Like gold and dollars, bitcoin is a protocol for *storing and transmitting value*.
So long as other people value bitcoins, they store value, just like gold and dollars, and you can also transmit this value to other people (by sending them bitcoins), just like gold and dollars.

Unlike gold, however, you do not need to be physically near someone to transmit bitcoins to them. Bitcoins can't be sent at nearly instant speeds between any two places on the planet. Bitcoin is therefore *independent of location*.

And unlike dollars, you do not have to trust a central authority to maintain balances (like banks or the Federal Reserve).
If you have dollars in a bank account, you are trusting that the bank really has the dollars.
If they are lying, you might be in trouble when you go to retrieve the dollars.
But with bitcoin, you don't have to trust anybody to use the protocol, if you know how to use it.
Bitcoin is decentralized--it *doesn't depend on a trusted central authority*.

That's bitcoin in a nutshell:
A *protocol* for *storing and transmitting value* that is both *independent of location* and *doesn't depend on a trusted central authority*.
It is also the first protocol to ever have these properties.
Oh, and one more thing: There will only ever be 21 million of them, but they are divisible to eight decimal places so there is plenty to go around.

How Bitcoin Works
-----------------

Bitcoin is often called a "decentralized digital currency", because it is digital, like dollars, but there is no person or company who runs it.
It is shocking that it is possible for such a thing to exist, and it's important to understand how it works.
But before we do that, we need to understand a few elements first:
* Hash functions
* Asymmetric key cryptography for digital signatures
* Peer-to-peer (p2p) networks

The Software
------------

In principle, if you could talk loud enough, fast enough, and could do complex cryptographic calculations in your head, you wouldn't need computers or the internet in order to use bitcoin, just like you don't need computers or the internet to follow the "drive on the right side of the road" protocol.
But because bitcoin is somewhat complicated, it is practical to use software to perform the protocol instead.
The first bitcoin client software was written by Satoshi Nakamoto and is available at bitcoin.org.
