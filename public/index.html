<p class="lead">
Bitcoin is a remarkable new invention that is likely to change the way our financial system works, and even the way our entire society works.
</p>

<p>
If you&#8217;ve heard of bitcoin, and you&#8217;re curious about it, but you don&#8217;t know where to begin with it, this guide is for you.
</p>

<h2 id="whatisbitcoin"><a href="#whatisbitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</a></h2>

<p>Since bitcoin is very novel, it&#8217;s hard to explain it in a few words.
We will discuss a few different ways of thinking about bitcoin: bitcoin is a protocol, bitcoin is open-source software, bitcoin is digital gold, and bitcoin is a public ledger.
</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisaprotocol"><a href="#bitcoinisaprotocol">Bitcoin is a Protocol</a></h3>

<p>Bitcoin is a protocol for storing and transmitting value that is both independent of location and doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a mouthful, so let&#8217;s go through these terms one-by-one and make sense of them.</p>

<p>First, bitcoin is a <em>protocol</em>, which means it is a way of going about doing something.
Another example of a protocol is driving on the right side of the road.
This is a way of going about doing something (driving on the street), where so long as other people do things this way (driving on the right side rather than the left side), it all works out.
Other important examples of protocols are: the internet, email, the web, using gold as money, and using dollars as money.</p>

<p>Like gold and dollars, bitcoin is a protocol for <em>storing and transmitting value</em>.
So long as other people value bitcoins, they store value, just like gold and dollars, and you can also transmit this value to other people, just like gold and dollars.</p>

<p>Unlike gold, however, you do not need to be physically near someone to transmit bitcoins to them. Bitcoins can be sent at nearly instant speeds between any two places on the planet. Bitcoin is therefore <em>independent of location</em>.</p>

<p>And unlike dollars, you do not have to trust a central authority to maintain balances (like banks or the Federal Reserve).
If you have dollars in a bank account, you are trusting that the bank really has the dollars.
If they are lying, you might be in trouble when you go to retrieve the dollars.
But with bitcoin, you don&#8217;t have to trust anybody to use the protocol, if you know how to use it.
Bitcoin is decentralized&#8212;it <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s bitcoin in a nutshell:
A <em>protocol</em> for <em>storing and transmitting value</em> that is both <em>independent of location</em> and <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.
It is also the first protocol to ever have all of these properties.
Oh, and one more thing: There will only ever be 21 million of them, but they are divisible to eight decimal places so there is plenty to go around.</p>

<h3>Bitcoin is Open-Source Software</h3>

<h3 id="bitcoinisdigitalgold"><a href="#bitcoinisdigitalgold">Bitcoin is Digital Gold</a></h3>

<p>
Gold has the wonderful property that you can&#8217;t send the same gold coin to two different people.
Gold, by its nature, cannot be double-spent.
Unfortunately, gold is hard to lug around and store.
What we would really like is to create money out of information, so that we can carry it around and store it with almost zero cost.
</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not easy to create money out of information, because information can be easily replicated.
Suppose we regarded some special files as being money.
What&#8217;s to stop someone from sending the same file to many different people?
In such a world, everyone would have infinite money, which wouldn&#8217;t be useful at all.
Money needs to be scarce.
</p>

<p>The traditional solution to this problem is to have a trusted central authority keep track of everyone&#8217;s balances.
That way, the trusted central authority can make sure no one is sending the same money to two different people.
Unfortunately, this system has a significant drawback:
So long as the trusted central authority is a human being, they cannot be trusted for long, and they will inevitably abuse their power to create more money to serve their own interests.
</p>

<p>
However, there is another solution by cleverly using cryptography.
Bitcoin is the first solution that is scarce and cannot be double spent, like gold, but is also easy to carry around and transmit because it is just information, like dollars.
Bitcoin is digital gold.
Or sound fiat money.
Whichever you prefer.
</p>

<h3>Bitcoin is a Decentralized Public Ledger</h3>

<h3 id="bitcoinismoney1.0"><a href="#bitcoinismoney10">Bitcoin is Money 1.0</a></h3>

<p>It is often said that bitcoin is &#8220;Money 2.0,&#8221; as though it were just like money, but with a few extra bells and whistles.
This is false.
All previous forms of money have been deeply faulty and should be regarded as beta versions bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the first complete solution to the problem of money.
Bitcoin is Money 1.0.
</p>

<p>Gold has many wonderful qualities that make it very well suited to be money, which is why it has held as money for thousands of years all over the world.
However, gold has a fundamental weakness: It cannot be transmitted over large distances.
Besides this irresolvable issue, gold is also difficult to carry and store and hard to divide (you can&#8217;t just break a coin in two).
Unless there is a breakthough in physics that gives us Star Trek technology that can beam gold between two remote locations, gold can never be used as money in the age of the internet.
Gold is best seen as something like Money 0.3 beta.
It&#8217;s all right, it serves the purpose, but it has bugs.
</p>



<h2 id="howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is often called a &#8220;decentralized digital currency&#8221;, because it is digital, like dollars, but there is no person or company who runs it.
It is shocking that it is possible for such a thing to exist, and it&#8217;s important to understand how it works.
But before we do that, we need to understand a few elements first:
<ul>
<li>Hash functions</li>
<li>Asymmetric key cryptography for digital signatures</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer (p2p) networks</li>
</ul>


<h2>Wallets: Using Bitcoin</h2>

<h3>Wallet Apps</h3>
<p>In principle, if you could talk loud enough, fast enough, and could do complex cryptographic calculations in your head, you wouldn&#8217;t need computers or the internet in order to use bitcoin, just like you don&#8217;t need computers or the internet to follow the &#8220;drive on the right side of the road&#8221; protocol.
But because bitcoin is somewhat complicated, it is practical to use software to perform the protocol instead.
The first bitcoin client software was written by Satoshi Nakamoto and is available at bitcoin.org.</p>
