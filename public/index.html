<p class="lead">
Bitcoin is a remarkable new invention that is likely to change the way our financial system works, and even the way our entire society works.
</p>

<p>
If you&#8217;ve heard of bitcoin, and you&#8217;re curious about it, but you don&#8217;t know where to begin with it, this guide is for you.
</p>

<h2 id="whatisbitcoin"><a href="#whatisbitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</a></h2>

<p>Since bitcoin is very novel, it&#8217;s hard to explain it in a few words.
We will discuss a few different ways of thinking about bitcoin: bitcoin is a protocol, bitcoin is open-source software, bitcoin is digital gold, and bitcoin is a public ledger.
</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisaprotocol"><a href="#bitcoinisaprotocol">Bitcoin is a Protocol</a></h3>

<p>Bitcoin is a protocol for storing and transmitting value that is both independent of location and doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a mouthful, so let&#8217;s go through these terms one-by-one and make sense of them.</p>

<p>First, bitcoin is a <em>protocol</em>, which means it is a way of going about doing something.
Another example of a protocol is driving on the right side of the road.
This is a way of going about doing something (driving on the street), where so long as other people do things this way (driving on the right side rather than the left side), it all works out.
Other important examples of protocols are: the internet, email, the web, using gold as money, and using dollars as money.</p>

<p>Like gold and dollars, bitcoin is a protocol for <em>storing and transmitting value</em>.
So long as other people value bitcoins, they store value, just like gold and dollars, and you can also transmit this value to other people, just like gold and dollars.</p>

<p>Unlike gold, however, you do not need to be physically near someone to transmit bitcoins to them. Bitcoins can be sent at nearly instant speeds between any two places on the planet. Bitcoin is therefore <em>independent of location</em>.</p>

<p>And unlike dollars, you do not have to trust a central authority to maintain balances (like banks or the Federal Reserve).
If you have dollars in a bank account, you are trusting that the bank really has the dollars.
If they are lying, you might be in trouble when you go to retrieve the dollars.
But with bitcoin, you don&#8217;t have to trust anybody to use the protocol, if you know how to use it.
Bitcoin is decentralized&#8212;it <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s bitcoin in a nutshell:
A <em>protocol</em> for <em>storing and transmitting value</em> that is both <em>independent of location</em> and <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.
It is also the first protocol to ever have all of these properties.
Oh, and one more thing: There will only ever be 21 million of them, but they are divisible to eight decimal places so there is plenty to go around.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisopensourcesoftware"><a href="#bitcoinisopensourcesoftware">Bitcoin is Open-Source Software</a></h3>

<p>
Bitcoin is open-source software that lets you, 1) view how many bitcoins you have, 2) send bitcoins to other people, and finally 3) mine for new bitcoins or transaction fees.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s important that bitcoin is open-source rather than closed-source.
There are two kinds of software: closed-source software, where the people who created the software do not want you to see how the software works or be able to modify it, and open-source software, where the creators want you to be able to see how the software works and be able to modify it.
Beacuse bitcoin is open-source, you are free to look at it in detail and see how it works, confirm that it is secure, and even modify it to suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to modify the bitcoin software, but you have to be careful: If you choose to modify the software in a backwards-incompatible way, you may not be able to send or receive bitcoins.
If you choose to make backwards-incompatible changes to bitcoin, you will need to convince other people to go along with your changes, otherwise you will effectively be locking yourself out of the network.
</p>

<p>When you run the bitcoin software, you will see your balance, which is how many bitcoins you have.
This balance is divisible to 8 decimal places, so for instance you may see that you have exactly 9.39387178 bitcoins.
However, you cannot have 9.393871789 bitcoins, since that requires too many decimal places (although it is possible that in the future we may all decide to allow greater precision in bitcoin balances).
You also cannot ever have more than 21 million bitcoins, since that is the limit of bitcoins that will ever be created.
</p>

<p>A bitcoin balance is actually made up of the balances of more than one address.
You can have as many addresses as you want.
An address is a place where you may receive bitcoins.
When you want to receive bitcoins from someone, you give them one of your addresses (for anonymity purposes, it is better to give a new address every time you wish to receive bitcoins, although that is not technically necessary).
Your balance is therefore the sum of the balances of all the bitcoin addresses you have.
</p>

<p>
A bitcoin address is the hash of a public key, and to each public key corresponds a private key.
Only you have your private keys&#8212;and you shouldn&#8217;t give them to anyone!
When you want to send bitcoins to someone, you type in their address, and your bitcoin software will sign a transaction using your private keys.
Since only you have your private keys, only you can sign transactions out of your addresses.
Other people on the network can verify that the person with the private keys must have signed the transaction without needing to see your private keys.
</p>

<p>The final thing you can do with bitcoin software is mine.
Mining is the process of verifying the recent pool of transactions, and calculating a proof-of-work hash for the transactions (plus the hash of the previous transactions), and when you find a hash that is sufficiently low, you are free to give yourself new bitcoins, as well as any bitcoins that people sending transactions have optionally included as transaction fees.
When miners verify transactions, they are performing the valuable service of making sure no one is double spending bitcoins or inventing bitcoins out of thin-air (although if you run a full-node, it is possible to verify transactions without mining).
Their reward is new bitcoins and transaction fees.
Mining is where new bitcoins come from, and it is how the security of the network is provided by computational power.
However, the rate with which new bitcoins are released gradually diminishes over time until we near 21 million.
At that point, miners will be rewarded almost entirely by transaction fees rather than new bitcoins.
</p>

<p>
In summary, bitcoin is open-source software (and as such can be viewed and modified), which lets you hold bitcoins, send bitcoins, and mine for bitcoins.
If this section was too technical for you, don&#8217;t worry, it takes a long time to absorb.
If you are curious, the <a href="#howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</a> section provides a more thorough explanation of how bitcoin works.
The next few analogies are easier to understand.
</p>



<h3 id="bitcoinisdigitalgold"><a href="#bitcoinisdigitalgold">Bitcoin is Digital Gold</a></h3>

<p>
Gold has the wonderful property that you can&#8217;t send the same gold coin to two different people.
Gold, by its nature, cannot be double-spent.
Unfortunately, gold is hard to lug around and store.
What we would really like is to create money out of information, so that we can carry it around and store it with almost zero cost.
</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not easy to create money out of information, because information can be easily replicated.
Suppose we regarded some special files as being money.
What&#8217;s to stop someone from sending the same file to many different people?
In such a world, everyone would have infinite money, which wouldn&#8217;t be useful at all.
Money needs to be scarce.
</p>

<p>The traditional solution to this problem is to have a trusted central authority keep track of everyone&#8217;s balances.
That way, the trusted central authority can make sure no one is sending the same money to two different people.
Unfortunately, this system has a significant drawback:
So long as the trusted central authority is a human being, they cannot be trusted for long, and they will inevitably abuse their power to create more money to serve their own interests.
</p>

<p>
However, there is another solution by cleverly using cryptography.
Bitcoin is the first solution that is scarce and cannot be double spent, like gold, but is also easy to carry around and transmit because it is just information, like dollars.
Bitcoin is digital gold.
Or sound fiat money.
Whichever you prefer.
</p>

<h3>Bitcoin is a Public Ledger</h3>

<h3 id="bitcoinismoney10"><a href="#bitcoinismoney10">Bitcoin is Money 1.0</a></h3>

<p>It is often said that bitcoin is &#8220;Money 2.0,&#8221; as though it were just like money, but with a few extra bells and whistles.
This is false.
All previous forms of money have been deeply faulty and should be regarded as beta versions bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the first complete solution to the problem of money.
Bitcoin is Money 1.0.
</p>

<p>Gold has many wonderful qualities that make it very well suited to be money, which is why it has held as money for thousands of years all over the world.
However, gold has a fundamental weakness: It cannot be transmitted over large distances.
Besides this irresolvable issue, gold is also difficult to carry and store and hard to divide (you can&#8217;t just break a coin in two).
Unless there is a breakthough in physics that gives us Star Trek technology that can beam gold between two remote locations, gold can never be used as money in the age of the internet.
Gold is best seen as something like Money 0.3 beta.
It&#8217;s all right, it serves the purpose, but it has bugs, and it&#8217;s obsolete.
</p>

<p>Fiat currency, like the dollar, has many of the same economic properties as gold (such as divisibility), but it has its own unique, fundamental flaw: you simply cannot trust a central authority not to eventually break its code of honor and print more money, double spend, freeze accounts, or otherwise serve its own interests at the expense of everyone else who uses the money.
Like the irresolvable locality of gold, fiat currency is irresolvably untrustworthy.
Fiat currency is like a test branch of the 0.3 beta version of money made by a violent psychopath.
In in fixing gold&#8217;s fundamental weakness, he introduced a new, more terrible weakness in the form of a secret backdoor that makes the psycho programmer King of the World.
We need a form of money that has none of these weaknesses.
</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the first form of money that has ever had all desirable features in one package.
Like gold and dollars, it can store and transmit value.
But unlike gold, its value can be transported over any distance, and unlike dollars, there is no flawed human at the control panel who may one day turn evil.
It is even better where the other forms of money weren&#8217;t bad&#8212;for instance, bitcoin is easily divisible to arbitrary precision, whereas making change in gold or dollars is only possible if you have the right change available.
Bitcoin is a very well-refined and thorough Money 1.0, and the only reason to continue using gold or dollars is due to social momentum or vendor lock-in.
</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not perfect, and will need to be modified slightly in the future to solve minor problems.
For instance, the present version of the Satoshi client would not be able to handle 1000 times the transaction volume, so it will need to have improved scalability.
But this is a problem that can and will be fixed, like all other minor issues.
When these fixes occur, we&#8217;ll bump up the version number to Money 1.1.
</p>



<h2 id="howbitcoinworks"><a href="#howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</a></h2>

<p>Bitcoin is often called a &#8220;decentralized digital currency&#8221;, because it is digital, like dollars, but there is no person or company who runs it.
It is shocking that it is possible for such a thing to exist, and it&#8217;s important to understand how it works.
But before we do that, we need to understand a few elements first:
<ul>
<li>Hash functions</li>
<li>Asymmetric key cryptography for digital signatures</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer (p2p) networks</li>
</ul>


<h2>Wallets: Using Bitcoin</h2>

<h3>Wallet Apps</h3>
<p>In principle, if you could talk loud enough, fast enough, and could do complex cryptographic calculations in your head, you wouldn&#8217;t need computers or the internet in order to use bitcoin, just like you don&#8217;t need computers or the internet to follow the &#8220;drive on the right side of the road&#8221; protocol.
But because bitcoin is somewhat complicated, it is practical to use software to perform the protocol instead.
The first bitcoin client software was written by Satoshi Nakamoto and is available at bitcoin.org.</p>
