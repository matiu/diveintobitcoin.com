<h1 id="diveintobitcoin"><a href="/">Dive Into Bitcoin</a></h1>

<p class="lead">
Bitcoin is a remarkable new invention that is likely to change the way our financial system works, and even the way our entire society works.
</p>

<p>
If you&#8217;ve heard of bitcoin, and you&#8217;re curious about it, but you don&#8217;t know where to begin with it, this guide is for you.
</p>

<h2 id="whatisbitcoin"><a href="#whatisbitcoin">What is Bitcoin?</a></h2>

<p>Since bitcoin is very novel, it&#8217;s hard to explain it in a few words.
We will discuss five different ways of thinking about bitcoin: <a href="#bitcoinisaprotocol">bitcoin is a protocol</a>, <a href="#bitcoinisopensourcesoftware">bitcoin is open-source software</a>, <a href="#bitcoinisdigitalgold">bitcoin is digital gold</a>, <a href="#bitcoinisapublicledger">bitcoin is a public ledger</a>, and <a href="#bitcoinismoney10">bitcoin is Money 1.0</a>.
These analogies give a high-level overview of bitcoin and don&#8217;t need to be read in order.
If you would like an in-depth description of how bitcoin works, that is in the next section, <a href="#howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisaprotocol"><a href="#bitcoinisaprotocol">Bitcoin is a Protocol</a></h3>

<p>Bitcoin is a protocol for storing and transmitting value that is both independent of location and doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a mouthful, so let&#8217;s go through these terms one-by-one and make sense of them.</p>

<p>First, bitcoin is a <em>protocol</em>, which means it is a way of going about doing something.
Another example of a protocol is driving on the right side of the road.
This is a way of going about doing something (driving on the street), where so long as other people do things this way (driving on the right side rather than the left side), it all works out.
Other important examples of protocols are: the internet, email, the web, using gold as money, and using dollars as money.</p>

<p>Like gold and dollars, bitcoin is a protocol for <em>storing and transmitting value</em>.
So long as other people value bitcoins, they store value, just like gold and dollars, and you can also transmit this value to other people, just like gold and dollars.</p>

<p>Unlike gold, however, you do not need to be physically near someone to transmit bitcoins to them. Bitcoins can be sent at nearly instant speeds between any two places on the planet. Bitcoin is therefore <em>independent of location</em>.</p>

<p>And unlike dollars, you do not have to trust a central authority to maintain balances (like banks or the Federal Reserve).
If you have dollars in a bank account, you are trusting that the bank really has the dollars.
If they are lying, you might be in trouble when you go to retrieve the dollars.
But with bitcoin, you don&#8217;t have to trust anybody to use the protocol, if you know how to use it.
Bitcoin is decentralized&#8212;it <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s bitcoin in a nutshell:
A <em>protocol</em> for <em>storing and transmitting value</em> that is both <em>independent of location</em> and <em>doesn&#8217;t depend on a trusted central authority</em>.
It is also the first protocol to ever have all of these properties.
Oh, and one more thing: There will only ever be 21 million of them, but they are divisible to eight decimal places so there is plenty to go around.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisopensourcesoftware"><a href="#bitcoinisopensourcesoftware">Bitcoin is Open-Source Software</a></h3>

<p>
Bitcoin is open-source software that lets you, 1) view how many bitcoins you have, 2) send bitcoins to other people, and finally 3) mine for new bitcoins or transaction fees.
</p>

<p>
It&#8217;s important that bitcoin is open-source rather than closed-source.
There are two kinds of software: closed-source software, where the people who created the software do not want you to see how the software works or be able to modify it, and open-source software, where the creators want you to be able to see how the software works and be able to modify it.
Because bitcoin is open-source, you are free to look at it in detail and see how it works, confirm that it is secure, and even modify it to suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to modify the bitcoin software, but you have to be careful: If you choose to modify the software in a backwards-incompatible way, you may not be able to send or receive bitcoins.
If you choose to make backwards-incompatible changes to bitcoin, you will need to convince other people to go along with your changes, otherwise you will effectively be locking yourself out of the network.
</p>

<p>When you run the bitcoin software, you will see your balance, which is how many bitcoins you have.
This balance is divisible to 8 decimal places, so for instance you may see that you have exactly 9.39387178 bitcoins.
However, you cannot have 9.393871789 bitcoins, since that requires too many decimal places (although it is possible that in the future we may all decide to allow greater precision in bitcoin balances).
You also cannot ever have more than 21 million bitcoins, since that is the limit of bitcoins that will ever be created.
</p>

<p>A bitcoin balance is actually made up of the balances of more than one address.
You can have as many addresses as you want.
An address is a place where you may receive bitcoins.
When you want to receive bitcoins from someone, you give them one of your addresses (for anonymity purposes, it is better to give a new address every time you wish to receive bitcoins, although that is not technically necessary).
Your balance is therefore the sum of the balances of all the bitcoin addresses you have.
</p>

<p>
A bitcoin address is the hash of a public key, and to each public key corresponds a private key.
Only you have your private keys&#8212;and you shouldn&#8217;t give them to anyone!
When you want to send bitcoins to someone, you type in their address, and your bitcoin software will sign a transaction using your private keys.
Since only you have your private keys, only you can sign transactions out of your addresses.
Other people on the network can verify that the person with the private keys must have signed the transaction without needing to see your private keys.
</p>

<p>The final thing you can do with bitcoin software is mine.
Mining is the process of verifying the recent pool of transactions, and calculating a proof-of-work hash for the transactions (plus the hash of the previous transactions), and when you find a hash that is sufficiently low, you are free to give yourself new bitcoins, as well as any bitcoins that people sending transactions have optionally included as transaction fees.
When miners verify transactions, they are performing the valuable service of making sure no one is double spending bitcoins or inventing bitcoins out of thin-air (although if you run a full-node, it is possible to verify transactions without mining).
Their reward is new bitcoins and transaction fees.
Mining is where new bitcoins come from, and it is how the security of the network is provided by computational power.
However, the rate with which new bitcoins are released gradually diminishes over time until we near 21 million.
At that point, miners will be rewarded almost entirely by transaction fees rather than new bitcoins.
</p>

<p>
In summary, bitcoin is open-source software (and as such can be viewed and modified), which lets you hold bitcoins, send bitcoins, and mine for bitcoins.
If this section was too technical for you, don&#8217;t worry, it takes a long time to absorb.
If you are curious, the <a href="#howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</a> section provides a more thorough explanation of how bitcoin works.
The next few analogies are easier to understand.
</p>



<h3 id="bitcoinisdigitalgold"><a href="#bitcoinisdigitalgold">Bitcoin is Digital Gold</a></h3>

<p>
Gold has the wonderful property that you can&#8217;t send the same gold coin to two different people.
Gold, by its nature, cannot be double-spent.
Unfortunately, gold is hard to lug around and store.
What we would really like is to create money out of information, so that we can carry it around and store it with almost zero cost.
</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not easy to create money out of information, because information can be easily replicated.
Suppose we regarded some special files as being money.
What&#8217;s to stop someone from sending the same file to many different people?
In such a world, everyone would have infinite money, which wouldn&#8217;t be useful at all.
Money needs to be scarce.
</p>

<p>The traditional solution to this problem is to have a trusted central authority keep track of everyone&#8217;s balances.
That way, the trusted central authority can make sure no one is sending the same money to two different people.
Unfortunately, this system has a significant drawback:
So long as the trusted central authority is a human being, they cannot be trusted for long, and they will inevitably abuse their power to create more money to serve their own interests.
</p>

<p>
However, there is another solution by cleverly using cryptography.
Bitcoin is the first solution that is scarce and cannot be double spent, like gold, but is also easy to carry around and transmit because it is just information, like dollars.
Bitcoin is digital gold.
Or sound fiat money.
Whichever you prefer.
</p>

<h3 id="bitcoinisapublicledger"><a href="#bitcoinisapublicledger">Bitcoin is a Public Ledger</a></h3>

<p>Bitcoin is a distributed public ledger that keeps track of the balance of bitcoins in every address, and which addresses gave bitcoins to which other addresses.
No one organization controls the ledger.
Everyone who participates in bitcoin helps enforce the rules.
And the rules are, basically, that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.
</p>

<p>
A ledger is a record of transactions.
The bitcoin ledger is the blockchain, which contains every bitcoin transaction that has ever occurred in chronological segments called blocks.
Technically, the blockchain does not include a running total of the balance in every address; it just contains the history of transactions.
The balance of an address can be calculated by summing the transactions.
</p>

<p>The blockchain is public knowledge.
Anyone who runs a mining node or a full node has a record of the blockchain.
Every time a miner finds a new block, this block is broadcast to the network and every other miner and full node adds this block to their copy of the blockchain.
Every miner and full node audits the new blocks&#8212;they verify that all bitcoins are accounted for properly in the sense that no new bitcoins have been created out of thin-air and no bitcoins have been double-spent.
</p>

<p>No one organization controls the blockchain.
If someone wishes to create bitcoins out of thin-air, they would have to convince every mining node and every full node to accept their counterfeit bitcoins, which is unlikely.
In order to make this even more unlikely, anyone who participates in bitcoin is encouraged to run a full node to audit the blockchain.
</p>

<p>The rules of bitcoin are as follows: 1) When someone wishes to transfer bitcoins, they broadcast their transaction to the network. 2) Miners pool recent transactions and try to find a proof-of-work hash on the transactions. 3) When a sufficiently low proof-of-work hash is found, this is called a block, and it is broadcast to the network. 4) The difficulty of the proof-of-work hash is adjusted every two weeks so that it always takes about ten minutes to find a block. 5) Miners get any transaction fees included in the block they found, plus N new bitcoins. 6) The number N is 50 for the first four years, 25 for the next four years, and so on, halving every four years. This eventually reaches a limit&#8212;it can be calculated that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s bitcoin: a giant public ledger containing the history of all bitcoin transactions.
Anyone can view the ledger and audit it&#8212;people who do this are either miners or full nodes.
Auditing bitcoin means making sure that the rules are being followed, and the rules are, basically, that miners get the new bitcoins when they find a block, and no one can double-spend or counterfeit bitcoins.
From this it is implied that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoins.
</p>



<h3 id="bitcoinismoney10"><a href="#bitcoinismoney10">Bitcoin is Money 1.0</a></h3>

<p>It is often said that bitcoin is &#8220;Money 2.0,&#8221; as though it were just like money, but with a few extra bells and whistles.
This is false.
All previous forms of money have been deeply faulty and should be regarded as beta versions bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the first complete solution to the problem of money.
Bitcoin is Money 1.0.
</p>

<p>Gold has many wonderful qualities that make it very well suited to be money, which is why it has held as money for thousands of years all over the world.
However, gold has a fundamental weakness: It cannot be transmitted over large distances.
Besides this irresolvable issue, gold is also difficult to carry and store and hard to divide (you can&#8217;t just break a coin in two).
Unless there is a breakthough in physics that gives us Star Trek technology that can beam gold between two remote locations, gold can never be used as money in the age of the internet.
Gold is best seen as something like Money 0.3 beta.
It&#8217;s all right, it serves the purpose, but it has bugs, and it&#8217;s obsolete.
</p>

<p>Fiat currency, like the dollar, has many of the same economic properties as gold (such as divisibility), but it has its own unique, fundamental flaw: you simply cannot trust a central authority not to eventually break its code of honor and print more money, double spend, freeze accounts, or otherwise serve its own interests at the expense of everyone else who uses the money.
Like the irresolvable locality of gold, fiat currency is irresolvably untrustworthy.
Fiat currency is like a test branch of the 0.3 beta version of money made by a violent psychopath.
In in fixing gold&#8217;s fundamental weakness, he introduced a new, more terrible weakness in the form of a secret backdoor that makes the psycho programmer King of the World.
We need a form of money that has none of these weaknesses.
</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the first form of money that has ever had all desirable features in one package.
Like gold and dollars, it can store and transmit value.
But unlike gold, its value can be transported over any distance, and unlike dollars, there is no flawed human at the control panel who may one day turn evil.
It is even better where the other forms of money weren&#8217;t bad&#8212;for instance, bitcoin is easily divisible to arbitrary precision, whereas making change in gold or dollars is only possible if you have the right change available.
Bitcoin is a very well-refined and thorough Money 1.0, and the only reason to continue using gold or dollars is due to social momentum or vendor lock-in.
</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not perfect, and will need to be modified slightly in the future to solve minor problems.
For instance, the present version of the Satoshi client would not be able to handle 1000 times the transaction volume, so it will need to have improved scalability.
But this is a problem that can and will be fixed, like all other minor issues.
When these fixes occur, we&#8217;ll bump up the version number to Money 1.1.
</p>

<h3 id="whatisbitcoinconcludingremarks"><a href="#whatisbitcoinconcludingremarks">What is Bitcoin? Concluding Remarks</a></h3>

<p>
It&#8217;s difficult to explain what bitcoin is because it is new and quite different than anything that has come before.
Imagine trying to explain what the internet was back in 1975.
Since nothing quite like it had existed before, there was a big mental hurdle to explain it to anyone.
The same is true for bitcoin.
</p>

<p>
We&#8217;ve discussed five analogies on what bitcoin is.
I hope these analogies have helped.
If you&#8217;re still scratching your head, note that we have not yet covered in detail how bitcoin actually works, which is covered in the <a href="#howbitcoinworks">next section</a>.
Another option is to gain experience actually using bitcoin.
For that, you will want to know how to use a <a href="#wallets">bitcoin wallet</a> to store and manage your bitcoins, and how to <a href="#tradingbuyingandsellingbitcoin">buy and sell bitcoin</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="howbitcoinworks"><a href="#howbitcoinworks">How Bitcoin Works</a></h2>

<p>Bitcoin is often called a &#8220;decentralized digital currency&#8221;, because it is digital, like dollars, but there is no person or company who runs it.
It is shocking that it is possible for such a thing to exist, and it&#8217;s important to understand how it works.
But before we do that, we need to understand a few elements first: <a href="#hashfunctions">hash functions</a>, <a href="#publickeysandprivatekeys">public keys and private keys</a>, and peer-to-peer (p2p) networks.</p>

<h3 id="hashfunctions"><a href="#hashfunctions">Hash Functions</a></h3>

<p>
A toaster is a function: it takes in bread and outputs toast.
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine"><strong>function</strong></a> in the computer sense is a program that that takes in data and outputs modified data.
A number goes in, and another number, possibly a different one, comes out.
Like a toaster, but virtual.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function"><strong>hash function</strong></a> is a special kind of function that takes in data and outputs something that looks like, although it isn&#8217;t, random data.
For instance, putting the word &#8220;hello&#8221; into something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256</a> hash algorithm produces this:</p>

<pre>2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824</pre>

<p>If you happen to be using a Linux or Mac computer, open up a terminal, and do this yourself with the sha256sum command:</p>

<pre>&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "hello")
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824</pre>

<p>It looks like random junk. But it&#8217;s not really random. Type that in several times, and it will always produce the same output:</p>

<pre>&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "hello")
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "hello")
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "hello")
2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824</pre>

<p>But if we modify it very slightly, say by capitalizing the H and hashing &#8220;Hello&#8221; instead of &#8220;hello&#8221;, we get a very different result:</p>

<pre>&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "Hello")
185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969</pre>

<p>It still looks like random junk, but now it&#8217;s completely different random junk than it was before. Compare:
</p>

<pre>2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
185f8db32271fe25f561a6fc938b2e264306ec304eda518007d1764826381969</pre>

<p>This is a key feature of hash functions: they output something that looks completely random, but you can easily reproduce the output by running the function again with the same input.
This feature allows hash functions to be used for <strong>proof-of-work</strong>, which is when some data is hashed with a nonce (a number), and the nonce is iterated until a very low value of the hash is found (which is a hash that starts with many zeros).
For instance, here is the word &#8220;hello&#8221; with a nonce prepended to it, and then hashed:
</p>

<pre>&gt;sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "10000 hello")
c748c0f280aba520974c4aea1f4b366421687e7dd2f3e122de62e011f72627a1</pre>

<p>If we try this with a different nonce, we get a different value:</p>

<pre>&gt;sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "10001 hello")
5923eb1c62d3588c3c88fb50bd582895e36bf0e38c7cb28ca8e08afc2f641cda</pre>

<p>If we try this with enough different nonces, we will eventually get a hash that starts with a 0.
We can write a short program in node.js that does this for us:
</p>

<pre>
crypto=require('crypto');

for (var i=0; true; i++) {
  var myhash=crypto.createHash('sha256').update(""+i+" hello").digest('hex');
  if (myhash[0]==0) {
    console.log(i);
    break;
  };
};
</pre>

<p>This program outputs the number 13, meaning the nonce we need is 13 to create a hash that starts with a 0. Indeed, we see that:</p>

<pre>&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "13 hello")
058fe74de5c867456e19e527a30a5243d2a54faa28aa028da19d494d168bc227
</pre>

<p>Notice how the first character is 0.
So in order to produce a hash that started with one zero (in hex&#8212;in binary, it would actually be 4 zeros), we had to run the hash function 13 times.
Suppose we wanted it to start with two zeros?
We can quickly modify our node.js program:</p>

<pre>
crypto=require('crypto');

for (var i=0; true; i++) {
  var myhash=crypto.createHash('sha256').update(""+i+" hello").digest('hex');
  if (myhash[0]==0 &amp;&amp; myhash[1]==0) {
    console.log(i);
    break;
  };
};
</pre>

<p>This outputs 66, and indeed:</pre>

<pre>&gt; sha256sum &lt;(echo -n "66 hello")
007800d611fddf2c0c64e1623511a3f7878e1012cddfe252a0fe0d87a53f40a5</pre>

<p>We had to run the hash 66 times, quite a bit more than 13 and far more than 1, in order to produce a hash that starts with two zeros.
We can see where this is going.
The more zeros we wish our hash to start with, the more times we have to run the hash function.
In fact, each zero makes the number of computations exponentially more numerous.
Roughly speaking, the first zero can be found after about 2<sup>4</sup>=16 hashes, since there are 2<sup>4</sup>=16 possibilities for the first number.
Finding two zeroes takes roughly 2<sup>4</sup>*2<sup>4</sup>=256 hashes.
Each new zero introduces a factor of 16 more computations that we have to do to be able to find a satisfying hash.
</p>

<p>Proof-of-work makes it possible to prove that a lot of computation was used to look at some data.
In this case we have been using the word &#8220;hello&#8221; as our data, but the data could have been anything, like an email.
By attaching a proof-of-work hash to an email, you can prove you&#8217;ve put a lot of computational work into the email, making it less likely to be spam (since spammers would not want to waste computational power sending out spam email).
This has been implemented and it&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.hashcash.org/">Hashcash</a>.
Finding a proof-of-work hash requires a lot of work since it requires many calls to a hash function, but it requires almost no work for someone to check to see that the work has been done, since that requires only a single call to a hash function.
</p>

<p>As we will see, bitcoin implements proof-of-work in order to prove that a lot of computational power has looked at transactions.
The more computational power that has looked at transactions, the the more we can rely on those transactions to not be reversed at a later time.
</p>

<p>There is one more way bitcoin uses hash functions:
It is almost impossible to know what data was input into a hash function by only seeing its output.
The only to know that is to try every conceivable input until you find the input that gives you the right output.
Bitcoin hides public keys this way&#8212;bitcoin addresses are not public keys, they are hashes of public keys.
But to understand this, we must first explain <a href="#publickeysandprivatekeys">public keys and private keys</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="publickeysandprivatekeys"><a href="#publickeysandprivatekeys">Public Keys and Private Keys</a></h3>

<p>Bitcoin uses something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">asymmetric key cryptography</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signatures</a> in order to verify that only the person who actually owns a bitcoin balance can send those bitcoins to someone else.
</p>

<p>The idea of asymmetric key crypography is this:
There is a piece of data, like a digital contract.
There is also a person has two numbers: a <strong>private key</strong>, and a <strong>public key</strong>.
This person can sign the data with their private key, producing a <strong>signature</strong>.
The person then distributes the data, their public key, and the signature.
Anyone can verify, using only the public key and the data, that the person who owns the private key must have used it to produce the signature.
Anyone can verify this without ever needing to see the private key.
The owner of the private key never needs to share their private key, and yet it is still possible for other people to confirm that they produced the signature.
</p>

<p>The fact that it is possible to do such a thing is extremely valuable for confirming someone&#8217;s identity.
In a way, a person&#8217;s public key is their name.
If you want to verify a person&#8217;s identity, simply provide to them a random number and then ask them to sign the random number.
If they are who they say they are, they will be able to produce a signature which you can verify corresponds to their public key.
If they are not who they say they are, they will not be able to produce a signature, or it will correspond to a different public key.
(It&#8217;s important that the number you provide be random, otherwise an adversary may have intercepted one of this person&#8217;s authentication messages at another time, and then could simply copy it on demand without needing to actually re-calculate the signature.)
</p>

<p>Asymmetric key cryptography is how bitcoin verifies that only the owner of a bitcoin balance is who is able to send those bitcoins, and not some imposter.
Each bitcoin address has a public key, and the person who owns that address also has the private key.
When someone wishes to send bitcoins, they sign a transaction with their private key.
Then they broadcast this transaction, along with the signature, and their public key.
Other people are able to verify that only the person who owned the private key could have signed this transaction.
They are able to verify this without ever needing to see the private key.
</p>

<p>Note that it is very important to keep your private keys private.
If someone else gets ahold of your private keys, they can sign transactions in your name, and no one else will be able to tell that it was really an imposter that signed the transaction.</p>

<p>There is one other complication in the way bitcoin handles balances:
A bitcoin address is a hash of a public key, not a public key.
When sending bitcoins to an address, no one knows the public key of that address (much less the private key), until that person chooses to send bitcoins out of their address, at which time they broadcast the public key (and they never broadcast the private key).
</p>

<p>We can use the website <a href="http://brainwallet.org/">brainwallet.org</a> to gain some experience with bitcoin signatures.
There are two primary kinds of information you can sign with a bitcoin address: a transaction, or a message.
A transaction is basically when you send bitcoins out of your address to another address.
A message is a piece of information that you may wish to sign for other purposes, say if you wish to verify that you own a bitcoin address to someone without having to reveal your private key.
On the <a href="http://brainwallet.org/#sign">sign message</a> page, the default private key is this:
</p>

<pre>5JeWZ1z6sRcLTJXdQEDdB986E6XfLAkj9CgNE4EHzr5GmjrVFpf</pre>

<p>The corresponding address, which is a hash of the public key, is this:</p>

<pre>17mDAmveV5wBwxajBsY7g1trbMW1DVWcgL</pre>

<p>And here is the default message that we can sign (although you could substitute any message you want):</p>

<pre>C'est par mon ordre et pour le bien de l'Etat que le porteur du présent a fait ce qu'il a fait.</pre>

<p>And finally, here is a signature produced based on this private key and message:</p>

<pre>G2Sy7dA+LZN0SJ+pzKXNlEDNST9A+TW0VI+jCtA37dgkudjYGzRHisDNdllAb0dyQAVByvQE/sHF4FXC7VL5Qrk=</pre>

<p>Note that the generation of a signature involves a random number, so every time you create a new signature, the signature will be different. If you try this on your own, you will get a different signature.</p>

<p>If we then jump over to the <a href="http://brainwallet.org/#verify">verify</a> page, we can check this message:</p>

<pre>C'est par mon ordre et pour le bien de l'Etat que le porteur du présent a fait ce qu'il a fait.</pre>

<p>And this signature:</p>

<pre>G2Sy7dA+LZN0SJ+pzKXNlEDNST9A+TW0VI+jCtA37dgkudjYGzRHisDNdllAb0dyQAVByvQE/sHF4FXC7VL5Qrk=</pre>

<p>Note that although we do not provide a public key explicitly, the public key can be derived from the signature, so the public key is known to someone verifying the signature.</p>

<p>And indeed, we see that this signature corresponds to this address:</p>

<pre>17mDAmveV5wBwxajBsY7g1trbMW1DVWcgL</pre>

<p>Which is the address corresponding to the private key we started with.
Now suppose someone else controlled this address, and we wanted to verify that they did in fact control it.
We could give them a random number, say, 482029485829038577747, and then have them sign that number.
Once they sign that number, they produce this signature:</p>

<pre>G6G6Qe3oa4KR7sRHNwE5gUSExEGvn4unyvsJBDXqvNEGh7oRt3Nt+5L1I/gl/hBbQXO5bbcj2DibHLjaLHlmaZQ=</pre>

<p>By verifying this signature, we see that it does in fact correspond to this address:</p>

<pre>17mDAmveV5wBwxajBsY7g1trbMW1DVWcgL</pre>

<p>Therefore we can know with confidence that the person we are talking with controls that address.</p>

<p>The type of asymmetric key cryptography used by bitcoin is called elliptic curve cryptography, and in particular it uses a curve called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1">secp256k1</a>.
Since the way bitcoin uses elliptic curves is to produce digital signatures, it also often goes by the name ECDSA, which means elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.
(It is also possible to use elliptic curves for encryption using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a>.)
If you would like to learn in detail how the mathematics of elliptic curves works, check out <a href="http://kakaroto.homelinux.net/2012/01/how-the-ecdsa-algorithm-works/">this article</a> and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/compsec/NewLectures/Lecture14.pdf">this set of lecture notes</a>.

<h2>Wallets: Using Bitcoin</h2>

<h3>Wallet Apps</h3>
<p>In principle, if you could talk loud enough, fast enough, and could do complex cryptographic calculations in your head, you wouldn&#8217;t need computers or the internet in order to use bitcoin, just like you don&#8217;t need computers or the internet to follow the &#8220;drive on the right side of the road&#8221; protocol.
But because bitcoin is somewhat complicated, it is practical to use software to perform the protocol instead.
The first bitcoin client software was written by Satoshi Nakamoto and is available at bitcoin.org.</p>

<p>Dive Into Bitcoin is an introductory guide for people who are curious about bitcoin, but don&#8217;t know where to start.
This guide is not intended to persuade anyone to use bitcoin who was not already interested.
Instead, it is designed to provide a platform for people who are already interested in bitcoin to get their bearings and find further information.
